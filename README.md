# UIColor+ExtrasDemo

> `UIColor+Extras` extends the existing UIColor class by providing 142 extra named colors. As such it does not require you to make any changes to your existing code beyond placing the folder `UIColor+Extras` in your project. It is packaged with a minimalistic `UIColor+ExtrasDemo` which allows you to scroll through all the available colors presented as colored horizontal strips overlayer with their color name.
